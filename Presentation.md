Ok, so with 5 minutes, I have like 5 slides?

- An intro slide -- comparing vs the typescript inference algorithm.

- A slide about the math? "demystifying the math"
  -> tying each image into my little animation doohickey

- A slide about unification, with an interactive demo
  -> what are the gnarly types I want to unify?
  ok I want like a couple of demos.
  1: left: a              | right: int
  2: left: array(a)       | right: array(int)
  3: left: (a, bool) => c | right: (int, d) => (m, n)

- A slide about the algorithm, walking through
  some sample function.
  fib doesn't seem powerful enough,
  quicksort seems a little too complex
  - I want to demo ... discovering a function type
  - and discovering the item type of an array
  - ALSOoo maybe demo a unification error?
  - maybeeee let polymorphism.... but probably not?
